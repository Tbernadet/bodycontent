# bodycontent
-modification of apidoc.js files to create a param @apibodycontent.
-this repo is not the original, all re right belong to "http://apidocjs.com/" and you can find the original git at:
  "https://github.com/apidoc/apidoc".
-this repo is here to help me for a non comercial project and all the documents where modified to feet my needs.
-it let you creat a parameter (@apibodycontent), it will create a <textarea> place, where you put your bodycontent parameters (json type) 
  for your post request, like in postman.
-it's not finished. when you use @apibodycontent, it only work as a visible content.
  (you can create a bodycontent parameters but cant use it).
  the apidoc project is not my works and im not a part of the crew. 
  this repo is a modified version created for a non comercial use only to learn devs languages.
